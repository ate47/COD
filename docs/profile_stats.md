# Profile stats

Here you can get the stats for a profile, with this API call

```
https://my.callofduty.com/api/papi-client/stats/cod/v1/title/{{title}}/platform/{{platform}}/gamer/{{username}}/profile/type/{{gameMode}}
```

The previous API call was called V2, it is not available since few months before VG's release

```
https://my.callofduty.com/api/papi-client/crm/cod/v2/title/{{title}}/platform/{{platform}}/gamer/{{username}}/profile/type/{{gameMode}}/
```

The V1 can't access weapon stats, only category stats. So we can't get weapon information anymore.

You have a lot of information available so I won't explain a lot more.
